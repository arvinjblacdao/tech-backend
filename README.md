The application was created using NodeJS, ExpressJS and SQL.

To run the application, the tech_backend.sql file may be imported locally on an SQL server, XAMPP was used for creating the source code using a windows OS and the tech-backend.postman_collection may also be imported in Postman for ease of testing on the routes.
